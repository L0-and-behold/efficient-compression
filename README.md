# efficient-compression
Regularization methods that substantially decrease the number of parameters of neural networks, while maintaining high test accuracy.

The folder `compressing_wikipedia` contains the codebase to train transformer decoder models on (part of) the Wiki40b/english datasets using different sparsity inducing training approaches (DRR, PMMP, RL1) in Pytorch.
